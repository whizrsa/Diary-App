# Diary-App
A simple Diary App developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project showcases my understanding of JavaScript, with a focus on DOM manipulation, JSON handling, and client-side storage. It also integrates the Marked library for enhanced markdown rendering, providing a superior user experience.
